# Stellar Dominion: System Requirements & Architecture Validation

## üö® SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS & DEPENDENCY ISSUES

### Critical Build Environment Issues
- ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Install Visual Studio Build Tools for Windows (C++ build tools workload required) - Rust toolchain (v1.89.0) is now installed and functional.
- ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Current linker errors prevent any compilation - Macroquad dependencies now compile successfully, basic Rust compilation works.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL** - Missing Windows SDK components required by macroquad graphics library - Windows 10 SDK not detected in registry but macroquad compiles. Monitor for runtime graphics issues.
- ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Install Rust toolchain if not present: Cargo v1.89.0 and rustc v1.89.0 confirmed installed and working.

### Dependency Resolution Problems
- ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Macroquad library requires specific Windows development environment - All external dependencies compile successfully. Build environment is functional for macroquad graphics library.
- ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Consider switching to cross-platform alternative if Windows toolchain unavailable - No longer needed, current toolchain works.
- ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Project currently unbuildable on this system configuration - System can now build Rust projects, compilation errors are now code-level issues only.

## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE ISSUES & RECOMMENDATIONS

### Event System Architecture Problems
- EventBus routing incomplete in `src/core/events.rs:123-126` - only TimeManager and PlanetManager handle events - Add complete match arms for all SystemId variants in EventBus::process_events method to route events to ResourceSystem, PopulationSystem, ConstructionSystem, PhysicsEngine, CombatResolver, UIRenderer, and SaveSystem.
- Missing `SaveSystem` import in `src/core/mod.rs:11` causing compilation failure - Add `SaveSystem` to the use statement importing from crate::systems module. Current import list is incomplete and prevents SaveSystem from being instantiated in GameState::new().
- Event subscription system inconsistent - some systems subscribe but don't implement handlers - Implement handle_event(&mut self, event: &GameEvent) -> GameResult<()> method for all systems that subscribe to events but currently have missing or stub implementations.

### Manager Pattern Violations
- Missing `handle_event` implementation in all managers except basic stubs
- PlanetManager resource storage validation uses incorrect `can_afford` logic - should check individual capacity limits
- Ship manager index rebuilding inefficient - use swap_remove pattern for O(1) deletions

### System Implementation Gaps
- All systems in `src/systems/` are placeholder implementations with empty methods
- No actual game logic implemented - systems only contain skeleton structures
- Missing mathematical operations on Vector2 type required by physics calculations
- UIRenderer completely unimplemented - no rendering or input handling

### Type System Issues
- Vector2 lacks mathematical operations (Add, Sub, Mul) needed by PhysicsEngine
- ResourceBundle validation logic flawed - `can_afford` used for capacity checking
- Missing serialization traits for SaveSystem functionality

## üîß ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED

### EventBus Pattern Strengthening
- Implement complete event routing for all systems in EventBus::process_events
- Add proper error propagation from event handlers
- Consider event priority system for deterministic processing order
- Add event validation to prevent invalid state transitions

### Manager Responsibility Clarification
- Managers should only own data and provide CRUD operations
- Move business logic from managers to appropriate systems
- Implement proper validation in all manager methods before state changes
- Add comprehensive error handling for all manager operations

### System Decoupling Enforcement
- Ensure systems only communicate through EventBus - no direct references
- Add architecture tests to prevent direct system coupling
- Implement proper GameSystem trait for all systems
- Validate fixed update order is maintained

### Performance Architecture Issues
- HashMap index management in managers inefficient for frequent updates
- Consider using generational indices or slab allocation for entity management
- Event processing could benefit from batching for better cache locality
- Memory allocations in tight loops should be pre-allocated

### Testing Infrastructure Gaps
- Architecture invariant tests incomplete - only basic compilation checks
- Missing integration tests for event flow validation
- No property-based testing for resource constraint validation
- Unit tests needed for all manager CRUD operations

## üéØ IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS

### Phase 1: Core Foundation
- Fix build environment and dependency issues first
- Complete EventBus routing implementation
- Fix resource storage validation logic
- Implement missing Vector2 mathematical operations

### Phase 2: System Implementation
- Implement TimeManager tick progression logic fully
- Add ResourceSystem production calculations
- Complete PopulationSystem growth mechanics
- Implement PhysicsEngine orbital calculations

### Phase 3: Integration
- Add comprehensive event handler implementations
- Complete manager validation methods
- Implement UIRenderer basic functionality
- Add SaveSystem serialization support

### Phase 4: Validation
- Complete architecture invariant test suite
- Add integration tests for system interactions
- Performance testing with target entity counts
- Error condition and edge case validation

## üîç ARCHITECTURAL COMPLIANCE ISSUES

### EventBus Architecture Violations
- Direct state mutation still possible through manager references
- Event ordering not guaranteed - could cause state inconsistencies
- Missing event validation and filtering mechanisms
- No protection against event loops or cycles

### Single Responsibility Violations
- GameState struct doing too much - consider splitting responsibilities
- Managers mixing data ownership with business logic
- Systems have unclear boundaries and responsibilities
- UI system mixed with game logic in some areas

### Dependency Inversion Issues
- Systems depend on concrete manager implementations
- Hard-coded update order in GameState::fixed_update
- Missing abstraction layers for external dependencies
- Tight coupling between core types and implementation details

### Error Handling Inconsistencies
- Some methods return GameResult, others panic or ignore errors
- Error types not comprehensive enough for all failure modes
- Missing error recovery mechanisms in critical systems
- Inconsistent error propagation through event system
