### Identified Gaps
1. **Architecture Enforcement**: Missing system update order validation, EventBus routing verification
2. **Cross-System Integration**: Limited workflow testing, insufficient failure scenario coverage
3. **Edge Case Coverage**: Boundary conditions, resource overflow, concurrent operations
4. **Performance Testing**: No scalability validation for target entity counts
5. **Error Recovery**: Insufficient robustness testing for corruption/interruption scenarios

## Refactor Priorities (Execution Order)

### Priority 1: Architecture Enforcement Enhancement
**Target File**: `tests/architecture_invariants.rs`
**Missing Coverage**:
- System update order validation (UI→Physics→Resources→Population→Construction→Combat→Time)
- EventBus subscription routing verification
- Cross-system isolation verification
- GameResult<T> return type enforcement
- Deterministic operation validation
- Resource integer boundary protection

### Priority 2: Integration Test Expansion
**Target File**: `tests/integration_tests.rs`
**Missing Coverage**:
- Complete resource production workflows
- Ship colonization with failure scenarios
- Construction chain integration
- Combat resolution flows
- EventBus ordering with conflicts
- Multi-system state consistency

### Priority 3: Physics Engine Robustness
**Target File**: `tests/physics_engine_test.rs`
**Enhancements Needed**:
- Ship trajectory interpolation
- Transfer window calculations
- Fuel cost edge cases
- Collision detection
- Performance with max entity counts
- Orbital mechanics extremes

### Priority 4: Planet Management Completeness
**Target File**: `tests/planet_manager_test.rs`
**Missing Tests**:
- Resource subtraction edge cases
- Building management validation
- Multi-planet operations
- Worker reallocation consistency
- Storage capacity upgrades

### Priority 5: Save System Robustness
**Target File**: `tests/save_system_integration.rs`
**Enhancement Areas**:
- Version compatibility/migration
- Corruption recovery
- Large-scale data handling
- Concurrent access scenarios
- Filesystem error handling

### Priority 6: System Unit Test Standardization
**Target Directory**: `tests/systems/`
**Standardization Needs**:
- Consistent error handling patterns
- GameEvent processing validation
- State transition testing
- Performance benchmarking

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Architecture Foundation (Priorities 1-2)
- Use test-code-reviewer to assess architecture_invariants.rs
- Use test-code-implementer to expand integration_tests.rs
- Focus on EventBus compliance and system isolation

### Phase 2: System Robustness (Priorities 3-4)
- Enhance physics and planet management testing
- Add comprehensive edge case coverage
- Validate error handling and recovery

### Phase 3: Data Integrity (Priority 5)
- Strengthen save system validation
- Add corruption recovery testing
- Performance and scalability validation

### Phase 4: Unit Test Unification (Priority 6)
- Standardize individual system tests
- Ensure consistent test patterns
- Add missing coverage areas

## Test Quality Standards

### Architecture Compliance
- All systems must communicate only through EventBus
- No direct system-to-system references
- All state mutations return GameResult<T>
- Fixed update order enforcement

### Coverage Requirements
- 100% EventType coverage in architecture tests
- All PlayerCommand types tested in integration
- Edge cases for resource boundaries (i32::MAX/MIN)
- Error path validation for all operations

### Performance Targets
- Tests must pass with 100 planets, 500 ships
- Save/load operations under 1 second
- No memory leaks in extended runs
- Deterministic behavior verification

## Agent Utilization Plan

### test-code-reviewer Agent Usage
1. **architecture_invariants.rs** - Assess current architecture validation completeness ✅ COMPLETED
2. **integration_tests.rs** - Review integration test coverage gaps
3. **save_system_integration.rs** - Evaluate robustness testing adequacy

### test-code-implementer Agent Usage
1. **Enhanced Architecture Tests** - Add missing system order/isolation validation ⚠️ INTERRUPTED
2. **Expanded Integration Tests** - Implement complete workflow testing

## Handover Protocol

If token limits require handover:
1. Update this document with completion status
2. Mark completed priorities in checklist
3. Document any architectural discoveries
4. Provide specific next steps for continuation
5. Include any test failures requiring investigation

## Technical Notes

### EventBus Testing Pattern
```rust
// Standard pattern for testing event flows
let mut event_bus = EventBus::new();
event_bus.queue_event(test_event);
event_bus.process_events(&mut game_state)?;
assert_event_in_history(&event_bus, expected_result);
```

### Architecture Validation Pattern
```rust
// Verify system isolation
fn test_no_direct_system_access() {
    // Should fail compilation if systems reference each other
    let _size_check = std::mem::size_of::<SystemType>();
}
```

### Integration Test Pattern
```rust
// Complete workflow validation
fn test_resource_production_cycle() {
    // Setup -> Event -> Processing -> Validation -> Cleanup
    let mut game_state = GameState::new()?;
    // ... test complete cycle with failure scenarios
}
```

This refactor plan ensures comprehensive testing coverage while maintaining the strict EventBus architecture that defines Stellar Dominion's design principles.
